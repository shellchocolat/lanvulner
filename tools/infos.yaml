mac_flood_switch: |
        MAC address flooding atttack is a type of network attack 
        where an attacker connected to a switch port floods the 
        switch interface with very large number of Ethernet frames 
        with different fake source MAC address.

        Within a very short time, the switch's MAC Address table 
        is full with fake MAC address/port mapping. Thus, the switch 
        cannot save any more MAC address in its MAC Address table.

        The consequence could desastrous. The switch can enters into 
        a fail-open mode and start behaving like a network hub. 
        And so frames are flooded to all ports (similar to broadcast 
        type of communication).
        
        The attacker's machine will be delivered with all the frames 
        between the victim and other machines, and so will be able to 
        capture sensitive data from network.

ntp_reflective: |
        NTP reflective amplification attack is a type of DOS attack.
        
        The attacker sends a packet with a forged IP address (victim's)
        and the server replies to this address.

        This is attack is called as amplification because the amount of
        data that the server will send back to the victim is bigger
        than the initial size of the packet sent by the attacker.

        The command sent to the NTP server is MON_GETLIST that return
        the list of most recent assets that have interacted with the 
        server. The reply could be 200 times the size of the request.

        And so an attacker with a 1 GB network interface can
        theoretically  generate 200 GB of traffic.


cdp_flood: |
        CDP is use by network engineers to view the network topology.

        Flooding the switch with CDP messages can cause a lot of trouble.
        Among them, we can freeze the OS running on the switch which
        will blocks anyone from remotely managing the swithc; we can
        also lock up the CPU which causes the switch to start dropping
        network traffic; and, when a switch is overwhelmed and can no
        longer forward frames it will start to forward frames out all
        ports like a hub (see also mac_flood_switch command).

dhcp_starvation: |
        In DHCP starvation attack, an attacker broadcasts large number
        of DHCP requests messages with spoofed source MAC addresses.

        If the legitimate DHCP server in the network start responding
        to all these fake DHCP requests, available IP addresses in the
        DHCP server scope will be depleted within a very short time.

        Once the available number of IP addresses in the DHCP server
        is depleted, network attackers can then set up a rogue DHCP
        server and respond to new DHCP requests from clients.
        The attacker can now launch a DHCP spoofing attack and
        start capturing sensitive network packet.

ssdp_reflective: |
        SSDP reflective amplification attack is a type of DOS attack.

        This is attack is called as amplification because the amount of
        data that the server will send back to the victim is bigger
        than the initial size of the packet sent by the attacker.

        The attacker will create a UDP packet with a spoofed IP 
        address (victim's). Then the attacker will send a spoofed
        discovery packet to each plug-and-play device with a 
        request for as much data as possible by setting the flag
        ssdp:rootdevice or ssdp:all

dos_blacknurse: |
        The blacknurse attack is a type of DOS attack based on ICMP
        flooding.

        Most ICMP attack are based on ICMP type 8 code 0, but blacknurse
        is based on ICMP type 3 code 3. And thus can be very effective
        even at very low bandwith.

        The targets are essentially firewall, routers. Those devices
        spend significant resources on processing common ICMP error
        messages such as "Port Unreachable" (type 3 code 3).

        The firewall will suffer performance issues, then stop 
        working very fast.

ping_of_death: |
        The ping of death is a type of DOS attack base on ICMP
        flooding.

        The size of a correctly-formed IPv4 packet including IP
        header is 65535 bytes, including a total payload size 84 bytes.

        Since send a packet larger thatn 65535 bytes violates the 
        Internet Protocol, attacker will send malformed packet in 
        fragments. When the target system attemp to reassemble the 
        fragments and ends up with an oversized packet, memory
        overflow could occur and lead to various system problem
        including crash.

dns_reflective: |
        DNS reflective amplification attack is a type of DOS attack.

        This attack required to know a DNS server IP (ex 8.8.8.8, or
        an internal DNS server) to make the DNS request, a spoofed 
        IP (vitcim's) that the DNS server will respond to, and finally
        a website url that contains a lot of content into its DNS
        response to the "ANY" command (dig @8.8.8.8 website.com ANY)

        As for all reflective amplification attack, the response 
        needs to be much larger than the request. This DOS attack
        is not really effective, unles for DNSSEC, because de facto
        DNSSEC provides a lot of content in its response.

arp_cache_poisoning: |
        mitm attacks

traceroute: |
        A simple traceroute to a host. You have to specify the 
        Time To Live (TTL, 10 to 30 is ok) that will be decremented by each
        middleware that has been encountered. You also have to specify the
        timeout (2 to 5 is ok) and the protocol to encapsulate inside the
        IP packet (TCP/UDP/ICMP).
